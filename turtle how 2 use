dropdown      (68 - 72)
hide ui       (74 - 76)

hello welcome to the how 2 use , imma learn you how to use it so first 
write this (the turtle library)
local library = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miroeramaa/TurtleLib/main/TurtleUiLib.lua"))()
or this (a backup)
local library = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PitchyATree/roblox-exploit-library/main/turtle%20library'))()

so now after this you need write this (8 max cause after you can get them)

local window = library:Window("yo") <-- change window to window2 or whatever you want make more ui than 1 and change yo to the title you want

so next if you want to add a button : 

window2:Button("Button name", function()     <-- you can change window2 to the ui you want the button in 
   print("pressed button")     <-- script button do
end)

if you want do a toggle : 

window:Toggle("Example toggle", true, function(bool)  <-- you can change window to the ui you want the toggle in 
    print(bool) -- bool is true or false depending on the state of the toggle
end)

if you want do a color picker : 

window:ColorPicker("Color Picker", Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255), function(color)
   print(color)
end)

if you want do a slider :

window2:Slider("Example Slider",0,100,20, function(value)
   game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = value
end)

add a text box : 

-- Name, callback

window:Box("Walkspeed", function(text, focuslost)
   if focuslost then
   print(text)
   end
end)
-- The callback will be called with two arguments, the text that the player inputted and whether the player has stopped writing

add a text : 

-- Text, color: setting color to true will give it a rainbow effect!

window:Label("Credits to Intrer#0421", Color3.fromRGB(127, 143, 166))

to add a dropdown : 

local dropdown = window:Dropdown("Example dropdown", {"Button 1", "Button 2", "Third button"}, function(name)
   print(name)
end)

how to add a keybind to hide the ui :

library:Keybind("P")

congrat now you have all to do some turtle script ! 
i hope it helped !!
